# The Dojo Project Management Site

The Dojo is a project management site built using React and Firebase as a backend. The site utilises Firebase to provide authentication services, storage and a realtime database. Users can register for an account and create projects for themselves and for others. Once logged in, users can see if other users are also online or not, create and delete projects and comment on existing ones.

With Firebase authentication and React Router 6, many of the pages are protected unless the user is authenticated.
